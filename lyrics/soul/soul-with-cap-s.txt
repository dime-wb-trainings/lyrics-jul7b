There's all kinds of music, everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast, and some like it slow
Some like it hot, some like it blue
Uh some like it old, and some like it new
Now I'm not liking country, and I'm not rappin' rap
Big band swing, just ain't my thing
Alternative ain't my snap
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S

Music makes you happy or it can make you sad
It can turn the worst day into the best you ever had
For entertainment value, if I had to choose
You and me might disagree 'cause I like rhythm and blues

Now I'm not dissin' disco, I'm not sayin' punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal, 'cause I got to have that funk
Is when I hear a soulful song
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
